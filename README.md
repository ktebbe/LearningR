# Introduction to R Class

These are the lesson plans and code for a class I taught to my co-workers in May 2019. It assumes no coding experience and is desinged to help students become quickly self-sufficient and excited about continuing learning more. 

Here are the lesson goals for each class:
1. Introduction to RStudio panes and importing/viewing data.
1. Computer science fundamentals: libraries, subsetting, conditionals, and plotting. Introduction to tidy data for Class 3.
1. Digging into your own data! Introduction to dplyr and grouping/summarizing.
1. The only class without coding! Learning how to turn a question into a sketch of a plot that would answer that question. 
1. Continuation of going from a question/hypothesis to thinking of a plot that can answer that question to making it come to life.
1. Exploring different types of plots in ggplot. Practice improving an existing plot for presentation. 
1. The frontier of what else is out there - intro to text analysis, Shiny applications, and spatial rendering.
